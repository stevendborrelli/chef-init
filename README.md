=========

Set up a basic chef client and the berkshelf gem. This is a quick way to started with chef-solo.

The scripts are based on the Introduction at http://gettingstartedwithchef.com.


The script will:

* Install the chef package from opscode.
* Install the `berkshelf` gem into chef's embedded ruby located at `/opt/chef/embedded/` 
* copies the `http://github.com/opscode/chef-repr` dir and points `.chef/knife.rb` to the `~/chef-repo/cooksbooks` directory
* Comes with an uninstall scirpt to remove chef, installed ruby gems and additional packages used to build berkshelf. 

Tested on:

	ubuntu1204
	
	rhel6.3

####Usage:

Quick install:

	curl -s https://raw.github.com/stevendborrelli/chef-init/master/bootstrap.sh | sudo bash

Cloning the repo: 

	git clone https://github.com/stevendborrelli/chef-init.git

Installing chef and supporting files:
	
	./bootstrap.sh


Uninstalling chef and berkshelf (the `.chef` and `chef-repo` directories will be untouched):
	
	./uninstall_chef.sh 


Note that uninstall will also remove gcc and build-essential, which may break your build environment.
